I’m glad to announce that I have joined the [Universidad de Montevideo (UM)](https://um.edu.uy/) as a professor in the **Master’s in Data Science**, offered by the *Facultad de Ciencias Empresariales y Economía*.  

I will be teaching the *Deep Learning* course, which provides a solid foundation in neural networks and modern architectures, including CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers. The course also covers project structuring, model optimization, and practical applications such as object recognition and face recognition, using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.  

This new role allows me to share my academic and research experience with graduate students and contribute to the development of advanced skills in data science and artificial intelligence at UM.
