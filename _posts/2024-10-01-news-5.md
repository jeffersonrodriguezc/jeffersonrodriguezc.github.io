 I commenced my doctoral studies in Computer Engineering at University of Cagliari, IT, initiating a structured research program in advanced deep learning for cybersecurity & Biometrics at the Pattern
 Recognition and Application Lab [PRA Lab](https://www.saiferlab.ai/labs/pralab).

 My research is mainly based on the creation of steganography and watermarking techniques for facial image authentication/verification. In addition to other topics in biometrics and security.
