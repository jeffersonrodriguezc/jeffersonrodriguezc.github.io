I’m excited to share that I recently had the opportunity to participate in the International Summer School on Biometrics in Alghero, Sardinia. This year's event was especially relevant to my research, as it focused on the impact of Generative AI on biometric systems.

Over the course of the week, I learned from 18 leading experts in academia and industry and attended keynote lectures from distinguished professors like Xiaoming Liu and Tomaso Poggio. We discussed crucial topics, including bias detection, biometrics ethics, and cybersecurity.

It was an incredibly enriching experience that allowed me to deepen my knowledge and connect with other researchers in my field. These events are a key part of my doctoral studies and help me stay current with the most important advancements in the industry.
