I am pleased to share that our paper, **“A COVID-19 Patient Severity Stratification Using a 3D Convolutional Strategy on CT-Scans,”** has been accepted for presentation at the **International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2021**. This study employs advanced 3D convolutional models to analyze CT scan data, aiming to improve patient severity stratification in clinical settings. 

This acceptance highlights our commitment to leveraging deep learning and image processing techniques for improved patient care and biomedical insights. I am grateful to my collaborators for their dedication and look forward to sharing our findings with the ISBI community.
