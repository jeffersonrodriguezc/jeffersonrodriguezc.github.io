I am pleased to announce that our paper, **“Understanding Motion in Sign Language: A New Structured Translation Dataset,”** has been accepted for presentation at the **Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV) 2020**. This work introduces a novel dataset and approach for translating sign language motions, offering new insights into the interplay between visual perception and language processing.

This acceptance underscores our ongoing dedication to advancing computer vision research with real-world applications. My colleagues and I look forward to sharing our findings and contributing to further discussions at ACCV 2020.
