I’m happy to share that our Biometric Unit has reached an important milestone: **our first two papers on watermarking and steganography have been accepted at important international conferences**.  

- At the [International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025)](https://2025.ijcnn.org/), we presented *[Fragile Watermarking for Image Certification Using Deep Steganographic Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13759)*.  
  This paper introduces a fragile watermarking method based on deep steganography to certify **ICAO-compliant face images**. By embedding a hidden image at issuance, we show how any later manipulation (compression, resizing, morphing, etc.) can be detected and even classified, providing a proactive tool for secure biometric documents.  

- At the [International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB 2025)](https://ijcb2025.ieee-biometrics.org/), we will present *[Deep Data Hiding for ICAO-Compliant Face Images: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19324)*.  
  This is the **first survey dedicated to data hiding for biometric images** under ICAO standards. It reviews recent advances in watermarking and steganography, highlights their strengths and weaknesses, and provides practical guidance for secure deployment in identity verification systems.  

These two publications mark the beginning of our group’s contribution to the international research community on **biometric security in ICAO scenarios**. We are excited to continue building on this foundation and exploring new approaches to watermarking, steganography, and image authentication.
