I am pleased to announce that beginning on **November 23, 2023**, I will be teaching Neural Networks classes for the Master's programs in Data Science and Big Data at **[EIG Business School](https://esgerencia.com/)**, in collaboration with the **[Universidad Internacional del Ecuador (UIDE)](https://www.uide.edu.ec/)**.

This posting provides an excellent opportunity to share my expertise in deep learning and to contribute to the academic growth of future professionals in the fields of data science and big data analytics. I look forward to engaging with the students and fostering a rigorous understanding of Neural Networks and their applications.
