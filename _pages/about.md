Welcome, my name is Jefferson Rodriguez and I am a systems and computer engineer from [Universidad Industrial de Santander](https://www.uis.edu.co/webUIS/es/index.jsp) with a master's degree in computer science.

My research focuses on computer vision topics applied to different applications using machine learning and deep learning models. However, I have worked in areas outside of computer vision by analyzing other types of information. In summary, the applications where I have a lot of experience are the following:

|Sign language recognition | Biomedical imaging applications |Time series forecasting |
