title: "TensorFlow: Data and Deployment by deeplearning.ai on coursera"
excerpt: "In this specialization, you continued to develop your understanding of
machine learning with TensorFlow: Data and Deployment. You have
gone beyond basic modeling and learned how to train and run your
models within a browser, optimize machine learning models for mobile
devices, and create effective data pipelines with TensorFlow Data
Services. Now that you’ve learned the various ways to deploy your
models, you’re well-prepared to take your models into the hands of
real people on all kinds of devices!<br/><img src='/images/certficates-4.png'>"
